# Citi-Bike Nwe York City 2020


As the new lead analyst for the New York Citi Bike Program, I am now responsible for overseeing the largest bike sharing program in the United States.
Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. 
However I am working on the year of 2020, the year that COVID-19 occurred. Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike Data webpage https://citibikenyc.com/system-data 
I choose 2020 because it was when the whole world shut down, and according to the analysis we were able to see NYC how people were back outdside of the house. So enjoy my Tableau- Analysis.
